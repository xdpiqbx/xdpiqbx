### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have completed Fullstack Developer (10 months) and Java Developer (10 months) courses in the last 3 years.
I have been successfully using my programming skills in my previous position over the last 2 years.
After over 17 years of service in law enforcement agencies and military formations,
now I want to change my profession and become a full-time programmer.
