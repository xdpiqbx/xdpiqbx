### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name's Artem.

I am a former law enforcement officer and former military.

Now I am switching my life and I want to become a programmer.

---

A long time ago I dabbled in HTML and CSS, with a bit of Javascript.

Back in 2011, I got acquainted with `C++` and learned it at a basic level. At the time it seemed too complicated to me.

I decided to study something simpler and my choice fell on PHP. While learning PHP, I got even better acquainted with HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery additionally studied SQL.

At the same time, I had a main job and I didn't spend enough time on programming.

After the police, I joined the [military service under a contract](https://do.gov.ua/en/main-page/). Then another year in the [French Foreign Legion (2REP, Calvi)](http://foreignlegion.info/units/2nd-foreign-parachute-regiment/). More than three years in the [State Bureau of Investigation](https://dbr.gov.ua/en/).

### WEB

However, since May 2022, I have started to pay much more attention to learning programming. I completed a long and very interesting Full Stack Developer course. During the course, I significantly improved my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS. Studied and can use: ReactJS, Redux, Node.js (NPM), MongoDB, Express.js, WEBPACK.

For work, I wrote a Telegram bot that reminded of colleagues' birthdays -> [repo](https://github.com/xdpiqbx/date-remainder-sf-production)
