### Hi there 👋 my name's Artem.

I am a former law enforcement officer and former military.

Now I am switching my life and I want to become a programmer.

---

A long time ago I dabbled in `HTML` and `CSS`, with a bit of Javascript.

Back in 2011, I got acquainted with `C++` and learned it at a basic level. At the time it seemed too complicated to me.

I decided to study something simpler and my choice fell on `PHP`. While learning `PHP`, I got even better acquainted with `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS` and `JQuery` additionally studied `SQL`.

At the same time, I had a main job and I didn't spend enough time on programming.

After the police, I joined the [military service under a contract](https://do.gov.ua/en/main-page/). Then another year in the [French Foreign Legion (2REP, Calvi)](http://foreignlegion.info/units/2nd-foreign-parachute-regiment/). More than three years in the [State Bureau of Investigation](https://dbr.gov.ua/en/).

### WEB

However, since May 2020, I have started to pay much more attention to learning programming. I completed a long and very interesting **Full Stack Developer** course. During the course, I significantly improved my knowledge in `HTML`, `CSS`, `Bootstrap`, `JS`. Studied and can use: `ReactJS`, `Redux`, `Node.js` (`NPM`), `MongoDB`, `Express.js`, `WEBPACK`, `Handlebars`.

For work, I wrote a Telegram bots:
- this bot reminded of colleagues' birthdays: [repo](https://github.com/xdpiqbx/date-remainder-sf-production)
- this bot helped keep track of vehicles in the unit and kept a history of each vehicle's refueling, including refueling receipts: [repo](https://github.com/xdpiqbx/sbi_refuel_bot)

And I wanted to write a web interface on React.js for refueling bot... but the war started. We had a lot of work trips, and there was simply no time for anything.

Also, the fuel accounting system has changed at work and the need to scale the bot has disappeared.

### JAVA

While I was learning the web, I really liked the backend (`Node.js`, `MongoDB`, `Express.js`). And when it became a little easier at work, I decided to start learning Java.

I started learning Java in May 2022. And I have already studied such topics:
- #### Java Core module:
  - `Generics`, `Java Collection Framework`, `Map`, `File`, `Streams`, `Stream API`, `lambdas`, `Threads`, `interfaces Executor`, etc.
- #### Java Developer module:
  - Maven, Gradle, Tests, SQL, JDBC, CRUD, Migrations (Flyway framework), Servlets (Tomcat), Web Filters, Cookie & Session, Thymeleaf, Hibernate
- #### Spring
  - Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Security
- #### CI/CD
  - Jenkins, Github Actions, Docker

*And I had to do all this exclusively in my own time, I could do it at work.*
